## Hi There, welcome to Carstens Github Profile. 🙋‍♂️

I am moving slowly to codeberg.org. And you should too. Or a self-hosted solution or what-ever. 

- 🔭 A new goal is the read and learn more C#, but also keep up with Python.
- 🔭 My current project is to get back into developing a Roguelike Game (either C# or Java)
- 🌱 Learning C# as I need it for my next Job and improving my ethical hacking skills
- 🎮 Been a Gamer since i can barely remember 🤷🏾‍♂️, you can hit me up on [Steam](//steamcommunity.com/id/cbrueggenolte).
- 💬 Ask me about anything you like. I know quite a lot about computers, which software might solve your problem or how to gain back privacy while using windows or macOS.
- 📝 Sometimes I also write something on my [blog](//cbrueggenolte.de)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: [Why do hidden files begin with a dot](//catonmat.net/unix-hidden-files)
